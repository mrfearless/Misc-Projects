# SendFolderToSendTo

In Windows Explorer you can use the SendTo content menu to move files to a destination that is listed as a submenu of the SendTo content menu.

This AutoIt script sends the selected folder to the special place that stores the SendTo submenus, so that you can then send files to that folder via the SendTo context menu, hence the name SendFolderToSendTo.
