Packages database

package name
package decription
package cost
package recurring cost (if not a one off cost)
package recurring cycle (monthly, yearly etc)
package discount (for buying in bulk cycles, 10%, 20% etc)


examples:

Widget Setup
Setup and installation of widget service and the widget 2009 product
€100
0
N/A
N/A


Member Subscription
Membership subscription fee for being member of widget club
€0
€25
Monthly
10%

buys membership for 6 months = 6 * 25 = €150 - (€150/100 * 10) = €150 - (€1.5 * 10) = €150 - €15 = €135


Maintenance
Quarterly maintenance of servers
€0
€30
Quarterly
20%

buys for 6 months = 6/3(*quarterly months) = 2 * €30 - (€60/100 * 20) = €60 - (€.60 * 20) = €60 - €12 = €48


to calculate costs

user package table

userid packageid usercycle nextdueamount
1		1		 3				 buys maintenance for half year

have to calculate diff in user cycle vs base cycle in package to update next payment amount

get packageid, if usercycle > 0 (once off) look up package in package table

get package, package cycle and compare

if user cycle > package cycle then calc discount 
	if package cycle = 1, mpackage = 1
	if package cycle = 2, mpackage = 3
	if package cycle = 3, mpackage = 6
	we can get base package months from cycles probably
	so we have package cycle in months vs users subscriped cycle in months
	for maintence example
	mpackage = 3, muser = 6
	6/3 = 2
	multiply that result by base package cost = €30
	store result
	get discount for package, if > 0
	finalcost = result - (result/100 * discount)
	store result in user subscription table for next due amount
	
	
	
adding a new package to users account
by default we assume package cycle as default
list of packages to select vs ones already added to account as like user forum permissions lists?
