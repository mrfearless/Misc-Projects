This is the application form for NewWorldOrder Clan Membership. Please read the following before making your application.

New World Order is a community clan and does not recruit based on skill. As a result applications may take some time as we like to get to know a candidate and vice versa.
So with that in mind, the minimum we look for is someone who will be active on the forums, active in-game, has a good laugh, enjoys chatting to all the regulars and clan members and generally is a top person. If you meet these requirements and more then of course we will be looking at your application and perhaps we may ask you to join us on a trial basis.
