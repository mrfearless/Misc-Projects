# phpBB Mods

Misc phpBB 2.x mods created a few years ago for the NewWorldOrder (NWO) CounterStrike Source gaming forum and clan.

* AFK Manager - Away from keyboard manager ([phpBB forum post](https://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=434&t=1794645)).
* Clan Application - Forum user page application form for joining NWO
* NWO Manager - Back end control panels for NWO forum administrators
* nwoadmins - Forum user page that lists NWO admin members (i think)
* nwomembers - Forum user page that lists NWO clan members (i think)
* Subscription Mod - Back end control panel for subcriptions

** Note:** Unlikely to be useable as these where made for an older phpBB version and mods have been overhauled and are now known as extensions.
